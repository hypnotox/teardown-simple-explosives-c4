A mod adding C4 explosives.

[h2]Features[/h2]

[h3]Unlimited C4[/h3]
You can plant as many C4 as you want.
Since the engine doesn't handle multiple explosions in one frame nicely only one C4 will be exploded per frame.

[h3]3 different high quality models[/h3]
This mod offers 3 different models you can switch to in-game, all of them are inspired by CS:GO / CS 1.6.
The default keybind to switch models is "o", but can be changed in the mod options.
The last selected model will be pre-selected the next time you start the game.

[h2]Usage[/h2]
When you have the tool selected simply left click to place a C4.
To explode all planted C4s, simply have the tool selected and right click while not in range to grab anything.
To switch the model just press "o" (default keybind). The currently selected model will be shown on the bottom left side.

(I, Dr. HypnoTox, am planning to develop more types of explosives, all under the name "Simple Explosives")
